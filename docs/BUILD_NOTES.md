## Preview demo configuration — pinned (post-PC-26)
Client observed Summary Ratios changing between preview bakes. Cause: demo-config drift, not
engine drift — PC-20..PC-23 previews were baked from pf_a_base, PC-26 from pf_a_ots_msr
(+ management_capital_target 0.10), unannounced. Verified: fixtures 9/9 stable across all
commits; management_capital_target leaves financials byte-identical (config_hash differs by
design). Standing rule: the canonical preview config is pf_a_ots_msr with management target
0.10, changed only on client instruction, and any change is called out in the reply.

## r60 — Opex literal commencement / late-recognition correction
- Fixes r59's semantic mismatch where a late `recognition.first_period` could leave earlier economic expense recognized on its original trajectory.
- Adds `flow_spec.start_period` as the canonical model-period ordinal for Operating Expense commencement; recurring flows are zero before commencement and growth is anchored at commencement.
- Recognition cycles are anchored to economic commencement. `first_period` must fall inside the first recurrence cycle, then repeats at the selected cadence.
- Backward-compatible migration: an r59-style late first recognition beyond the initial recurrence interval, with no explicit `flow_spec.start_period`, infers commencement at that same first-recognition period. Thus Annual + first recognition M35 begins at M35 and repeats M47/M59... rather than recognizing earlier periods.
- UI exposes `Expense begins M#/Q#` separately from Recognition timing.
